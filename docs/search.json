    "text": "2024\n\nBest Subset Selection via a Modern Optimization Lens – A Review\n\n\nDescription\n\nWe reviewed the landmark work of Bertsimas et al. (2016), which proposes scalable Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) techniques for best subset selection in linear regression. This approach allows for exact sparse solutions by formulating the ℓ₀-constrained problem into a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) framework. We also explored their Discrete First Order (DFO) algorithm for fast approximate solutions and warm-start initialization, along with theoretical guarantees on convergence and sparsity recovery.\n\nRegressionSubset SelectionOptimization\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\nConformalized Survival Analysis – A Review\n\n\nDescription\n\nIn this project we review the methodology involving inference using conformal prediction proposed by Candès et al. (2023), which can be used with any survival prediction methods to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. We begin with conformal prediction for basic regression models and adapt similar techniques to the survival analysis regime.\n\nReportSlides\nSurvivalReview\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\nConditional Calibration for FDR Control Under Dependence – A Review\n\n\nDescription\n\nStudied the theory and methodology proposed by Fithian and Lei (2022) to adaptively calibrate separate rejection thresholds for each p-value to control overall FDR under different dependence structures.\n\nSlides\nMultivariateReview\n\n\nSparse Principal Components Analysis and Its Generalization\n\n\nDescription\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction. We discuss Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), which provides sparse loadings to resolve PCA’s interpretability issues. We also explore GAS-PCA, a generalization of SPCA that performs better in finite samples. Based on Zou et al. (2006) and Leng & Wang (2009).\n\nReportSlidesCode\nMultivariateRegressionReview\n\n\nBayesian Forecasting of UEFA Champions League\n\n\nDescription\n\nWe simulate the UEFA Champions League under alternative seeding schemes using a probabilistic Bayesian forecasting model. The aim is to evaluate the effect of seeding changes on tournament outcomes and team advancement. Based on Corona et al. (2019).\n\nReportSlidesCode\nBayesianSports Analytics\n\n\nFast and Robust Bootstrap for Regression Estimate Distribution\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis report discusses Fast Bootstrap for estimating the distribution of robust regression estimates, based on MM-estimators. It avoids non-convex optimization and uses a system of linear equations for each bootstrap sample, with robustness from residual-based weights.\n\nReportSlidesCode\nRobustnessBootstrapRegression\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nRobust Variable Selection via Rank-Based LASSO\n\n\nDescription\n\nWe present Rank-LASSO, a robust variable selection method for high-dimensional regression settings (\\(p \\gg n\\)), which improves over LAD-LASSO using thresholded score statistics. Based on Rejchel and Bogdan (2020), this approach performs well even with heavy-tailed errors.\n\nReportSlidesCode\nRegressionHigh-DimensionalRobustnessReview\n\n\nNonparametric Modal Regression via KDE\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis project reviews nonparametric modal regression using kernel density estimation. We explore its consistency properties, prediction sets, and bandwidth selection strategies. Based on Chen et al. (2016).\n\nReportSlidesCode\nNonparametricRegressionReview\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nStudy of Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure\n\n\nDescription\n\nModeled RMSD (protein tertiary structure deviation) using multiple linear regression with 9 features. We performed diagnostics including multicollinearity tests, residual analysis, and variable selection to validate the model.\n\nReport\nRegression"

    "title": "Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."
