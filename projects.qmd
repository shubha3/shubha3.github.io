### Best Subset Selection via a Modern Optimization Lens – A Review

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

We reviewed the landmark work of [Bertsimas et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1214/15-AOS1388), which proposes scalable Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) techniques for best subset selection in linear regression. This approach allows for exact sparse solutions by formulating the ℓ₀-constrained problem into a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) framework. We also explored their Discrete First Order (DFO) algorithm for fast approximate solutions and warm-start initialization, along with theoretical guarantees on convergence and sparsity recovery.

### Conformalized Survival Analysis – A Review

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

In this project we review the methodology involving inference using conformal prediction proposed by [Candès et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkac004), which can be used with any survival prediction methods to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. We begin with conformal prediction for basic regression models and adapt similar techniques to the survival analysis regime.

### Conditional Calibration for FDR Control Under Dependence – A Review

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

Studied the theory and methodology proposed by [Fithian and Lei (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1214/21-AOS2137) to adaptively calibrate separate rejection thresholds for each p-value to control overall FDR under different dependence structures.

### Sparse Principal Components Analysis and Its Generalization

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

Principal Component Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction. We discuss Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), which provides sparse loadings to resolve PCA's interpretability issues. We also explore GAS-PCA, a generalization of SPCA that performs better in finite samples. Based on [Zou et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1198/106186006X113430) and [Leng & Wang (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.0012).

### Bayesian Forecasting of UEFA Champions League

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

We simulate the UEFA Champions League under alternative seeding schemes using a probabilistic Bayesian forecasting model. The aim is to evaluate the effect of seeding changes on tournament outcomes and team advancement. Based on [Corona et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.07.009).

### Fast and Robust Bootstrap for Regression Estimate Distribution

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

This report discusses Fast Bootstrap for estimating the distribution of robust regression estimates, based on MM-estimators. It avoids non-convex optimization and uses a system of linear equations for each bootstrap sample, with robustness from residual-based weights.

### Robust Variable Selection via Rank-Based LASSO

<details>
<summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>

We present Rank-LASSO, a robust variable selection method for high-dimensional regression settings ($p \gg n$), which improves over LAD-LASSO using thresholded score statistics. Based on [Rejchel and Bogdan (2020)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/20-120.html), this approach performs well even with heavy-tailed errors.
