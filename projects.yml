- title: "Conformalized Survival Analysis – A Review"
  year: 2023
  description: >
    In this project we review the methodology involving inference using conformal prediction proposed by Candès et al. (2023), which can be used with any survival prediction methods to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. We begin with conformal prediction for basic regression models and adapt similar techniques to the survival analysis regime.

- title: "Conditional Calibration for FDR Control Under Dependence – A Review"
  year: 2022
  description: >
    Studied the theory and methodology proposed by Fithian and Lei (2022) to adaptively calibrate separate rejection thresholds for each p-value to control overall FDR under different dependence structures.

- title: "Sparse Principal Components Analysis and Its Generalization"
  year: 2022
  description: >
    Principal Component Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction. We discuss Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), which provides sparse loadings to resolve PCA's interpretability issues. We also explore GAS-PCA, a generalization of SPCA that performs better in finite samples. Based on Zou et al. (2006) and Leng and Wang (2009).

- title: "Bayesian Forecasting of UEFA Champions League"
  year: 2022
  description: >
    We simulate the UEFA Champions League under alternative seeding schemes using a probabilistic Bayesian forecasting model. The aim is to evaluate the effect of seeding changes on tournament outcomes and team advancement. Based on Corona et al. (2019).

- title: "Fast and Robust Bootstrap for Regression Estimate Distribution"
  year: 2022
  description: >
    This report discusses Fast Bootstrap for estimating the distribution of robust regression estimates, based on MM-estimators. It avoids non-convex optimization and uses a system of linear equations for each bootstrap sample, with robustness from residual-based weights.

- title: "Robust Variable Selection via Rank-Based LASSO"
  year: 2021
  description: >
    We present Rank-LASSO, a robust variable selection method for high-dimensional regression settings (p >> n), which improves over LAD-LASSO using thresholded score statistics. Based on Rejchel and Bogdan (2020), this approach performs well even with heavy-tailed errors.

  year: 2020
  description: >
    Modeled RMSD (protein tertiary structure deviation) using multiple linear regression with 9 features. We performed diagnostics including multicollinearity tests, residual analysis, and variable selection to validate the model.
