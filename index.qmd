:::{#hero-heading}

I am Shubha, a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at University of Pittsburgh. I am advised by Dr. Zhao Ren. 

My research focuses on differential privacy and high-dimensional statistical inference. I am especially interested in the intersection of statistical theory and practice, including the development of privacy-preserving methods that are both theoretically optimal and practically implementable.

I got my Master's degree in Statistics from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and got my Undergraduate degree from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata. During my master's, I worked on statistical signal processing and non-linear model analysis, advised by Dr. Amit Mitra.
