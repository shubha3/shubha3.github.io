:::{#hero-heading}

I am Shubha, a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.pitt.edu/) at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Zhao Ren](https://www.stat.pitt.edu/people/zhao-ren). 

My research focuses on differential privacy and high-dimensional statistical inference. I am especially interested in the intersection of statistical theory and practice, including the development of privacy-preserving methods that are both theoretically optimal and practically implementable.

I got my Master's degree in Statistics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math) and got my Undergraduate degree from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata](https://www.sxccal.edu/). During my master's, I worked on statistical signal processing and non-linear model analysis, advised by [Dr. Amit Mitra](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~amitra/).
